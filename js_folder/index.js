//INTO TO JAVASCRIPT EXERCISE

// A. TASK 1:VARIABLES and OPERATORS
// 1. Create a variable called “language” and assign it the value “JavaScript”. Then create
// a variable called “score” and assign it the value “10”.

// 2.Create two variables called “length” and “width”. Assign each variable a value of 10 and 5 respectfully. Use
// the variables to calculate the area of a rectangle with the length and width specified (remember area = length x width).
// Write the following to the console using CONCATENATION and BACKTICKS: 
// “The area of the rectangle is …” where … is the area you calculated.

// 3.Create two variables called “num1” and “num2.” Assign each variable a value of 10 and 4 respectfully.
// Calculate and display in the console what the remainder is if num1 is divided by num2.

// 4.Using the variables you created in the previous step, output the results
// of the division in the following format: “num1 / num2 = x remainder y.” HINT: Backticks


// B. Task 2:Data Types
// 1. Define the following data types with your own contents[ 'integer', 'decimal', 'string', 'array'(minimum: 3 items), 'Object'(minimum: 4 values)]
// 2. Once you’ve created the variables, display them to the console
// 3. Use the ‘typeof’ function to check each variable
// 4. Create an array with numbers and strings. Comment what data type you expect this tobe. Then use the ‘typeof’ function on this array
// 5. Create a null variable and an undefined variable

// ***********C. Task 3. functions and contional statements************
// N.B. READ WITH UNDERSTANDING!!!
//  1.  Create 3 functions to convert R1000 into dollars, euros and pounds. Take function naming into consideration!
//  2.  Create a function that takes a value and calculates the amount entered including VAT (15%), amount entered should be R400.
//      Then display the message in the console, "The amount after tax is ...".
//  3.  Declare 3 variables 1stNum, 2ndNum, 3rdNum and assign values of 8, 20 and 14 respectfully. Now write a function that compares “num1” and “num2” and 
//      displays the larger value.
//  4.  Write a function that determines whether “num1” is odd or even and displays the
//      result. (Tip: remember the modulus operator %)
//  5.  Next, write a JavaScript conditional statement to sort the three numbers(1stNum, 2ndNum, 3rdNum) from largest to smallest.
